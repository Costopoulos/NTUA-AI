Implement KNN and Naive Bayes and compare our implementations with those of scikit-learn. 
Multilayer perceptrons.
We added numba, which is an open-source JIT compiler that translates Python code and Numpy into fast machine code, achieving the speeds of C++. We even surpassed the running time of scikit-learn in one function (our precision was not as high, though).
